# github-misc-scripts

Miscellaneous GitHub scripts, `gh` commands, API calls, GraphQL queries, etc. for power user automation.

See the folder categories:

- [api](/api/README.md) *direct API calls using `curl`*
- **[gh-cli](/gh-cli/README.md)** üöÄ ‚ú® ‚¨ÖÔ∏è *most updated and comprehensive scripts using `gh`, `gh api`, and `gh api graphql`!*
- [git](/git/README.md) *Git-related scripts/commands*
- [graphql](/graphql/README.md) *GraphQL queries using `curl`*
- [scripts](/scripts/README.md) *standalone scripts and specialized tools*

> [!TIP]
> The **[gh-cli](/gh-cli/README.md)** folder is the most maintained; I've started adding both API and GraphQL queries in there using `gh api` and `gh api graphql` commands.
